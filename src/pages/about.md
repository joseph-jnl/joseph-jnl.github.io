I'm currently a data scientist at Capital One building out [credit risk models](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for our [small business credit cards](https://www.capitalone.com/small-business/credit-cards/). 

In my free time I enjoy reading history books, working on my sci-fi adventure novel, and learning more about reinforcement learning.
